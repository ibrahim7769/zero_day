Zero Day Project
Welcome to my first project in my full-stack engineering course! The goal of this project was to set up my Git and GitHub account, create a repository, and push my first file to the remote server.

Project Details
Task
The task for this project included:

Installing Git on my computer if it wasn't already installed.
Configuring my basic info (name, email) on my local machine.
Creating a public repository called zero_day on GitHub.
Creating a README.md file with a small Markdown text to present the project.
Adding the README.md file to Git, committing the change with the message "My first commit", and pushing to the remote server/origin.
Steps Taken
To complete the project, I followed these steps:

Installed Git on my computer.
Configured my basic information using the Git command line.
Created a zero_day repository on GitHub using the website's graphic interface.
Created a README.md file using a command line editor and wrote a small Markdown text to present the project.
Added the README.md file to Git, committed the change with the message "My first commit", and pushed to the remote server/origin.
Repository
GitHub repository: https://github.com/your-username/zero_day
File: README.md
Conclusion
Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me to get started with Git and GitHub. I'm looking forward to using these tools more in the future and continuing to improve my skills in software engineering.
